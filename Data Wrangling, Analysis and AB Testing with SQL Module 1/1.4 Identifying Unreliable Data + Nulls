--Using any methods you like determine if you can you trust this events table.

SELECT * 
FROM dsv1069.events_201701

--data seems complete but event time is limited to '2017-01%'


SELECT * 
FROM dsv1069.events_ex2

SELECT COUNT(*)
,parameter_name
FROM dsv1069.events_ex2
GROUP BY parameter_name

SELECT *
FROM dsv1069.events_ex2 
WHERE event_name != 'view_item' 
AND parameter_name NOT IN ('viewed_user_id', 'test_assignment', 'test_id')

--Something is strange about the parameter_name. Only shows values for test prompts and the 'viewed_user_id'


--Imagine that you need to count item views by day. You found this table 
--item_views_by_category_temp - should you use it to answer your question?

SELECT *
FROM dsv1069.item_views_by_category_temp

-- There are no dates to show when the counts are from. This is an incomplete table that needs more columns of data to be meaningful. 


--Is this the right way to join orders to users?

SELECT *
FROM dsv1069.orders
JOIN dsv1069.users 
ON orders.user_id = users.parent_user_id 

SELECT *
from dsv1069.users 
WHERE parent_user_id is null 

-- parent_user_id is null is many cases, therefore the query will give misleading data in lots of cases.
