# Projects and Assignments using SQL

## Overview:
The files include SQL questions assigned to me and the corresponding scripts I wrote to query relevant data. These questions were designed by an instructor at UC Davis to assess my proficiency across a broad range of SQL concepts and skills.

## Data Sources:
The information I pulled was sourced from the Chinook public database as well as datasets from the USDA.
