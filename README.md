# Projects and Assignments using SQL

## Overview:
The files include SQL questions assigned to me and the corresponding scripts I wrote to query relevant data. These questions were designed by an instructor at UC Davis to assess my proficiency across a broad range of SQL concepts and skills.

## Skills and Knowledge Applied:

- Writing basic SQL queries using the `SELECT` statement  
- Filtering data with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` clauses  
- Sorting data with `ORDER BY`  
- Grouping data and performing aggregations using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`  
- Writing subqueries for more complex data retrieval  
- Performing joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`) to combine data from multiple tables  
- Using `CASE` statements for conditional data transformation  
- Inserting new records with `INSERT INTO`  
- Updating existing records with `UPDATE`  
- Deleting records with `DELETE`  
- Creating tables with `CREATE TABLE`  
- Modifying table structures using `ALTER TABLE`  
- Dropping tables with `DROP TABLE`

## Data Sources:
The information I pulled was sourced from the Chinook database as well as datasets from the USDA.
